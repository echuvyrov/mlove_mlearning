# Two Kaggle competitions I participated in  
I had quite a lot of fun and also learned a lot through solving real-world problems. So I created these and added detailed comments for my own future references and also want to share them with others who want to learn and practice some data wrangling and machine learning skills.

Project 1 NY Taxi Trip duration prediciton (top 40%)  
Project 2 Personalized Medicine for cancer treatment (top 16%)

I used the-state-of-the-art XGBoost algorithm for both projects (really hard to get competitive with other methods on the leaderboard nowadays). I separated each project into 2 phases: feature analysis and production run, just to make it easier to show the workflow.
Any feedback is welcome.
