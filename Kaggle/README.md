# Two Kaggle competitions I participated in  
I had quite a lot of fun and also learned a lot through solving real-world problems. So I created these and added detailed comments for my own future references and also want to share them with others who want to learn and practice some data wrangling and machine learning skills.

Project 1 NY Taxi Trip duration prediciton (top 40%)  
Project 2 Precision Medicine for cancer treatment (top 5% stage 1)

The original datasets can be downloaded from Kaggle website:
NY Taxi Trip:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration/data
Precision Medicine: 
only 4 of them are needed: training_variant.zip, training_text.zip, test_variant.zip, test_text.zip. The rest of the data are for stage 2 which is not in my notebook.

I used the-state-of-the-art XGBoost algorithm for both projects (really hard to get competitive with other methods on the leaderboard nowadays). For those who are learning about xgboost, it should be helpful to see its use in practice.

Any feedback is welcome.
